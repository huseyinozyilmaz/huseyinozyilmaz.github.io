Today I heard from my director that our company received a letter from the Secretary of the Queens Awards for Enterprise to say we won the Queen's Awards for Enterprise: Innovation 2012. 

What a great news! It is an absolute pleasure to be part of this success and celebrate it as being the head of software development.
