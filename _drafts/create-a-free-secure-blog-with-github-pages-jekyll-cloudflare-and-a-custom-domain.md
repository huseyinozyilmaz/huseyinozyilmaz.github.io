I have been hosting my personal website in various hosting companies since 2003. I always wanted to have a busy website where I share my experince with technology, software development and similar topics. However, first, I have never managed to find enough spare time to fulfill this dream. Second, I am not a good writer at all. I like to talk about things rather than write about them. I always admired people who can seamlesly transform their thoughts into words and convert them to flowing narratives.

Nevertheless, having a personal website has given me an opportunity to experiment with different technologies. God knows how many times, I rewrote my website with different languages and framworks such as PHP (Codigniter, Slim), Java (Spring MVC, REST, JSP), Node.js and AngularJS. This kept me upto date with trending technologies and practices.

I am rewriting my website again. This time I am using Github Pages, Jekyll, Cloudflare and my custom domain.
