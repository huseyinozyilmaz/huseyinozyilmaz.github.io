Managing software development is about managing complexity. Every new piece of code increases overall complexity of the system. This is the same complexity that urges every developer to re-design and re-code the whole system from scratch. Virtual nature of software development enables it to expand beyond the borders that are initially anticipated. It does so with a cost of complexity. The nature of current programming languages plays a major role in contributing to this complexity. The fact that it is always easier to write code than reading a piece of code that has been written by someone else. Most of the time, this difficulty convinces developers to re-write. By doing so, they add more complexity to the system. Every new line of code you added to the system needs to be debugged, has to be read and understood, has to be supported and maintained. Therefore, your best code is the one that you haven't written. If you can recruit a developer to solely remove code then that would be great.
