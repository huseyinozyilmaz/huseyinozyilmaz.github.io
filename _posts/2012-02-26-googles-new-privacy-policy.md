Google with the latest changes in its privacy policy has raised the price of its all services including search, gmail, youtube. 

We don't need to send any money; all we have to do is to pay it with our privacy by providing more information about ourselves including mobile numbers, caller information, GPS location etc. Or, is it the fact that our privacy has lost its value and became less valuable so we have to give more to satisfy Google and continue using the same services? If so, who is making our privacy less valuable then?
